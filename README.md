# Theme: Work Table Item Showcase
My project showcases common items found on a digital creator's work table.

### Featured Items:

1. Laptop: The central hub of digital creation
2. Camera: Capturing moments and creating content
3. Headphones: For immersive audio experiences
4. Cup of Tea: The essential comfort drink for long work sessions

## Render
The `Render` directory has seperate .blend file for all the objects I created, and then I added them into a room I created to make a scene. In each folder I have multiple high quality render images plus snapshots of work during the process. This is the final output of the room with all the objects.
